# LongitudinalProfileFitting

Repository holding all the code I used for fitting longitudinal profiles from CORSIKA simulations. A lot of this was used for fitting the profiles in the mass separation analysis but with updates to make it more modular.

Things to update:
1. Add a submission script file that can read in all .long files, do the fits, and save .txt files.
2. Majorly clean up helper functions in the 'tools' directory.
3. Clean up plotting function also...
